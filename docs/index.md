This document is intended to provide context for the high-level network design options available for integrating VMware SDWAN with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  While the hope is to cover the main methods available for integrating with the various network and workload constructs available in these environments, itâ€™s important to note that not all customer designs, security requirements, and enhancements to IaaS networking/security offerings can be accounted for.  That said, every attempt is made to point out where a point in time assumption or design constraint has been made as well as linking to sites where relevant (and hopefully more up to date) documentation can be found.  In general, most designs should be possible to accommodate within the listed options, but your mileage may vary.
